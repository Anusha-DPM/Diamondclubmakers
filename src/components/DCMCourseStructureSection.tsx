            All weekly lessons and all other topic segments are entirely over WhatsApp during each of the 24 weeks. They begin with a complete and detailed progression from A-Z on how I perform Invisalign within my high producing 700 plus cases a year only comprising 1/3 of my 5.1 million collections office. From the consult all the way to completion with each and every step between. I include internal and external marketing, case examples, Clincheck reviews and guidance, patient management, and ways to make Invisalign one of the more profitable procedures within your office while driving your overall growth to new heights. The last third of the course is focused on practice management, creating time and space for the huge increase in production and collections you are about to experience, amplifying your efforts by creating an efficient team around you, and so much more.

            Because the entire course is always in the palm of your hand, your education doesn't interfere with the varied and over-scheduled professional and personal obligations we all have. It won't take you out of your office for a single day. This means you won't lose any production as you inevitably do with conventional CE. It doesn't interfere with your family's vacation schedule, or the kids soccer game. All you need to do to bring your practice to an entirely new level is what you are doing now, be on your phone on a daily basis. You also learn from the varied backgrounds and skills of your classmates through their interactions. I have found this daily interaction in the palm of your hand to be the most rewarding and educational platform almost all have ever experienced.
