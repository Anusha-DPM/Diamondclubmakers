                  I will show you how to go from 40 Invisalign cases to 80, 80 cases to 200, and 200 cases to 400 a year. Not just how to do more. But, how to fit all of that within your current practice using minimal resources while significantly adding to your general dentistry production. How to build efficiency and predictability as your Invisalign volume grows. How to literally make more by doing less.

                    Almost every DCMer has more cases in the six months of the class than in the entire year prior to DCM. With significant continued growth continuing after the class ends. Over the course of a career the impact is incalculable.

                    Most DCM dentists at least <span className="font-bold">double their profit per hour</span> on their Invisalign cases. All while significantly and profoundly reducing their amount of doctor time and their overall chair time. This frees up a significant amount of time and space to do the most profitable thing they do, restorative. And that has a huge impact on the overall practice's collections.

And some will tell you they have earned well over <span className="font-bold">1 million more</span> in practice revenue within that same six month period. It is that profound.

                    DCM doctors consistently will comment that the amount of content in each of the 24 lessons alone is like a two-day course that would cost them at least $2500 and two lost days of production from being out of the office. Times 24 lessons would be 48 days out of the office at a cost of 60k just for the CE without considering lost production, travel, etc. The fact is this content is off the charts impactful all taking place in the palm of your hand on your timeline. (Or there is always $1 for 100k a year)
