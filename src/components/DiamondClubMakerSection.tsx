              I have taken large multi-dentist big city offices who are stuck at Platinum to Diamond. Small rural single 3 chair offices from Gold to Diamond. And brand-new dentists just starting their office with very little Invisalign experience from Bronze to Diamond. All within the six-month course. And while not everyone reaches Diamond, almost all do more Invisalign, do it significantly more profitably, with greater predictability, with confidence and knowledge that they couldn&apos;t and can&apos;t get anywhere else. This almost always leads to a substantial rise in overall practice collections. Which leads DCM doctors to long-term business and financial security. And the only thing that anyone needs to become another DCM success story is the desire to do more, to do it better, and to create happy patient&apos;s that appreciate all you do while significantly increasing your income.

              Sorry no DSO offices at this point in time. I choose to serve the small dentist/business like myself. In an effort to help them remain independent and to thrive in this ever-increasing competitive world.

              Diamond Club Makers costs around 11k. Which is no small number. Some ask, isn&apos;t that a lot of money for a CE course? Fair questions, but a flawed perspective. It&apos;s not about how much money a course costs. It&apos;s about how much money that course can make you.
            </p>
            
            <p className="font-sansation-regular text-[#6b6b6b] leading-relaxed" style={{ fontSize: '17px' }}>
              The reality is that almost every DCM graduate would tell you they made a minimum of 10-fold back easily during the six months of the course alone. Many have made upwards of $250,000 to an almost unbelievable million back within those same six months. And none of that accounts for the staggering amount of money from increased income they make over the entire year or even their career. I know that it&apos;s tough to believe, but this is what DCM graduates consistently report.
            </p>
            
            <p className="font-sansation-regular text-[#6b6b6b] leading-relaxed" style={{ fontSize: '17px' }}>
              Additionally, most dentists have taken a day or two course. They may pay $500 to $2500 for that course. If they spent a day they could have been working. They lost 8 hours and 20-30k in income because they had not been in the office producing. (If you are not making at least 20-30k a day then you definitely need this course). Only to learn a few pearls that give them very little ROI and fails to make significant change in their stalled minimal growth practice. If that works for you, then keep doing what you&apos;re doing, and this course is not for you.
            </p>
            
            <p className="font-sansation-regular text-[#6b6b6b] leading-relaxed" style={{ fontSize: '17px' }}>
              But if you want to do something better, if you want to improve your practice by leaps and bounds, if you want a 10-fold PLUS return on investment (understated) in the six months of this course alone. And if you are wise enough to think outside the box you are trapped in. Then DCM is for you.
            </p>
            
            <p className="font-sansation-regular text-[#6b6b6b] leading-relaxed" style={{ fontSize: '17px' }}>
              If you are still unsure, I will happily make you a deal. Pay me nothing now. But since I am investing in you. I want return for my investment. So, you sign away 1% of any and all future practice growth every year over the next ten years. Then and only then will I be truly compensated for the millions of extra dollars I have helped you achieve.
            </p>
            
            <p className="font-sansation-regular text-[#6b6b6b] leading-relaxed" style={{ fontSize: '17px' }}>
              Then there are some that would rather buy a 10k shiny piece of equipment that you use once or twice a month until you forget about it, and it collects dust in the storage closet. Why not invest in yourself. The untapped power within you to produce more. The only thing holding anyone back is desire and knowledge. I share that knowledge. You just need to bring the desire.
            </p>
            
            <p className="font-sansation-regular text-[#6b6b6b] leading-relaxed" style={{ fontSize: '17px' }}>
              Others jump on board with programs like Scheduling Institute. Amazing content and for hundreds of thousands of dollars over time they will make you a lot of money. But why are you paying them an ungodly amount more?
            </p>
            
            <p className="font-sansation-regular text-[#6b6b6b] leading-relaxed" style={{ fontSize: '17px' }}>

                Continue to sit on the sidelines missing out on your real and true income potential. What&apos;s another year or two? I can tell you it is 100&apos;s of thousands of dollars and millions over the course of your career.

              <p className="font-sansation-regular text-[#6b6b6b] leading-relaxed" style={{ fontSize: '17px' }}>
                Take minimally effective programs that you miss work and lose more than you make.

              <p className="font-sansation-regular text-[#6b6b6b] leading-relaxed" style={{ fontSize: '17px' }}>
                Buy some fancy piece of equipment that promises everything just like the other fancy pieces of equipment in your storage closet did. Or start using your best piece of equipment to its maximum potential (your brain).

              <p className="font-sansation-regular text-[#6b6b6b] leading-relaxed" style={{ fontSize: '17px' }}>
                Pay 100&apos;s of thousands of dollars for something with real change.
